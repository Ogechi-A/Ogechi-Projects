Created a fully functional course registration tool/website for my Web Development Course. To get access to the private project code, please email agboogechi_03@icloud.com.

- For the project, I used MongoDB to manage the database.

- Node.js and JavaScript for handling the back-end/server side.

- HTML and CSS for handling the front-end/client side.

- Express for handling requests from the server- side to the client -side and vice versa.

- To ensure smooth functioning, I conducted extensive testing using Mocha test files.

**List of some features implemented on the website include:**

_1. Login & Logout feature

2. New user registration into the database.

3.  Real-time update advanced course search(by CRN or Course Name).

4. Add/Drop course feature which also alerts if courses to be added conflicts with the other.
 
5. View students schedule in relation to the courses registered.

6. Update user Information._
